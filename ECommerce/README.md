### Description

An Ecommerce website that specializes in selling computer parts. Application users have the 
ability create accounts, login, add items to cart and checkout with a cart. We currently have 10 items in the store to sell, with
two of those items being displayed on the home page (to entice potential buyers to check out the rest of our products).
We are capturing several claims when a user registers and logs in. The user (or admin) email address as well as thier first name, last name, 
and password are utilized to authenticate user identity.
